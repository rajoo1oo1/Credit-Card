## Credit Card Financial Dashboard
Overview: The Credit Card Financial Dashboard project provides a comprehensive visualization of credit card transactions and financial insights. It utilizes SQL for database management, Python for data extraction and insertion from CSV files into a MySQL database, and Power BI for creating an intuitive dashboard interface.

Project Steps:

## Step 01: Define Project Objective
My aim is to create a dynamic credit card weekly dashboard, offering real-time insights into critical performance metrics and trends. This dashboard will empower stakeholders with the tools needed to seamlessly monitor and analyze credit card operations, ensuring effective decision-making and strategic planning.

## Step 02: Data Gathering:
I have meticulously collected data in CSV format and seamlessly integrated it into an SQL table, mirroring a real-life data pipeline scenario. This meticulous process ensures the integrity and reliability of the data, laying a robust foundation for accurate analysis and actionable insights.

## Step 03: Dashboard Creation using Power BI and DAX:
Harnessing the power of Power BI and the flexibility of DAX, I have constructed a sophisticated dashboard that goes beyond standard visualization. Leveraging Power BI's rich array of visualization options and DAX's analytical capabilities, I have designed an interactive dashboard that provides deep insights into credit card operations.
Through dynamic charts, graphs, and slicers, stakeholders can explore key performance metrics such as customer age group, customer income group, job type, education and many more.
Additionally, the dashboard features drill-down functionality, allowing users to dive into granular details and identify underlying patterns and trends. With Power BI's seamless integration with SQL, my dashboard will remain up-to-date with real-time data, ensuring that stakeholders always have access to the latest information.
